# README

There are three main components in this repository:

- **The folder containing Jupyter Notebooks**: you will find the Jupyter Notebooks used to:
  - handle the data containing the law documents;
  - build different models to classify the summary of a law document to a law branch. After this, train this classifier;
  - analyze the data avaliable to train the classifier;
  - fine tune a classifier; and
  - assess the performance of a classifier.
- **The folder containing an application**: the app is responsible for providing an example of a real use case which the classifier could be used.
- **The folder containing the page for the course**: this repository was created to store resource for MAC0499 course from IME-USP. Therefore, one of the requirements is to have an HTML page that wraps up all the information needed to share. This folder is the only one that does not have a README due to the requirements.

In order to get more information about the folders, access them and read the README.
